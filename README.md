Installation
------------

To install just clone the repo inside you home directory. If you already have a .emacs.d directory in your home folder remove or rename it.

To clone the repo and all its submodules you can use the following command:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:elyezer/.emacs.d.git
```
